I've played video games for as long as I can remember, so it was only a matter of time that I tried my hand at creating some myself.

This little game (only a handful of levels) was made as a part of an online course found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/). My primary goal with this project was to
- gain further understanding of Unity development
- pick up some fundamentals of video game design and development
- produce a small game which could be hosted on my website

##### Early work in progress, before there was any ~ atmosphere ~

I believe I acheived my goals and now have a small proof of concept game I can call my own. The only thing I'm unhappy with is the lighting in this small game - publishing via WebGL can impact it. However, I think it is more than sufficient for what I intended to do.

**What's next?:** After being inspired by smash hit Stardew Valley, I've thought about changing it up to create a 2D proof of concept game with either Unity or Godot. Though I would also like to continue this course.
